                    <p>
                        I graduated in <strong>2024</strong> from <strong>Nnamdi Azikiwe University</strong> with a
                        degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong>. During my academic journey, I developed a solid
                        foundation in programming and design principles, and further refined my skills during my
                        industrial training at <strong>Digitanotion System</strong>, the leading tech
                        firm in Awka. There, I gained hands-on experience delivering real-world tech solutions and
                        collaborating with a professional team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, Iâ€™m advancing my technical expertise in <strong>React</strong>, aiming to
                        create dynamic, interactive web applications. Additionally, I am deeply interested in
                        <strong> cybersecurity</strong> and aspire to become a leader in the field while building my
                        own tech company in the future.
